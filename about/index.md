I am Mateu Aguil√≥ Bosch. I am a web technologist living in
[Mallorca](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=mallorca#map=10/39.6143/2.9117).
I work with big enterprise projects, and small companies. Most of the time I
work with [Drupal](https://drupal.org), although I always use the technology
that makes more sense for each project. I am known in the Drupal community for
being the coordinator of the official [API-First initiative](https://www.drupal.org/about/strategic-initiatives/api-first).

I have an increasing interest in the privacy of my data and those who surround
me, so expect that type of content in my blog. I don't have social media, but I
am responsive to email <code>mateu at mateuaguilo.com</code> and through my
[Drupal.org contact form](https://www.drupal.org/user/550110/contact). I share
several projects in [GitHub as e0ipso](https://github.com/e0ipso). I am also
starting to use [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@e0ipso), but I am not sure if
that will stick.
