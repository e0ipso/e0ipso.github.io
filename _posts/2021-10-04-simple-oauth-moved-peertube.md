I just moved my video playlist containing documentation for Simple OAuth from YouTube to my self hosted PeerTube instance. I did this because I belive on our digital rights and our [digital autonomy](https://techautonomy.org/).

<!-- more -->

I believe in a better model for the digital world. This is extremely important as a society because there is no boundary between the digital and the physical world anymore. Our lack of rights in the digital world lead to abuse and inequality in the physical world (sometimes called the "real" world).

Moving a playlist for documentating a Drupal module will not solve any of those problems. However, this is my prerrogativet to do (it is my content), and it may help to inspire others to follow this initiative.

This is the link to the new playlist: [https://video.mateuaguilo.com/my-library/video-playlists/b3b96ff7-8791-4815-a2a5-54091b6da326](https://video.mateuaguilo.com/my-library/video-playlists/b3b96ff7-8791-4815-a2a5-54091b6da326).
