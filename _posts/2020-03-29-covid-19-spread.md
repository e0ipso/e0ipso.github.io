This weekend marked week number two of house confinement in Mallorca. I wanted to come up with a way to explain our
three year old what is going on, why he can't go to schools and how much longer he will need to remain locked. Merc√®, my
wife, liked the idea so I thought to re-do it while recording so I can share it.

Our parenting values are **respect** towards the child (involves mostly tone, transparency of information, and truthful
information), and **affection** (involves mostly hugs, expressing emotions, and patience). I did this because I wanted
him to know what is going on, and I wanted the information to come from me. 

This is the recording I made in **Catalan**, my primary language. I made this for my local community.
