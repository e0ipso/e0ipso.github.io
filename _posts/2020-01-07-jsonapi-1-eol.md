This is a re-post of https://wimleers.com/blog/jsonapi-1-eol.

On 7 January, 2020, the Drupal module JSON:API 1.x was officially marked unsupported. This date was chosen because it is exactly 1 year after the release of JSON:API 2.0, the version of JSON:API that was eventually committed to core. Since then, the JSON:API maintainers have [been](https://humanbits.es/web-development/2019/01/07/jsonapi-2/) [urging](https://wimleers.com/blog/drupal-8.7-jsonapi) [users to upgrade to the 2.x branch](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi/releases/8.x-2.0) and then to switch to the Drupal core version.

We understand that there are still users remaining on the 1.x branch. We will maintain security coverage of the 8.x-1.x branch for 90 days. That is, on 6 April, 2020, all support for JSON:API, not in Drupal core, will end. Please upgrade your sites accordingly.
