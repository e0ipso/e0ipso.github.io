This idea is separate and completely unrelated to the
[Documentation and Help Initiative](https://www.drupal.org/community-initiatives/documentation-and-help-initiative).
My goal is to be able to link to the article and videos I create for my Drupal
contributions, which I create outside drupal.org. This comes after I have had to
point to multiple people to those links, even if they are in the project's page.

<!-- more -->

My idea is to add a card on some appropriate admin pages related to the tasks
described in the articles and videos. The card should be unobtrusive and
dismissible. Once dismissed, it will not be shown again.

What do you think? Is it a cool pattern, or something that feels spammy and gets
in the way?
