Recently I read "[Click Here to Kill Everybody](https://www.schneier.com/books/click-here/)" by [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com). I
really recommend this book to anyone. It is not targeted to a technical audience, although you might
enjoy it a tiny bit extra if you are familiar with cyber security.

In this post I want to highlight one of my favorite parts, where Schneier lists the principles
vendors of Internet enabled products should follow for a safer world.

In chapter 6 _What a Secure Internet+ looks like_, Schneier lists 10 principles to secure our
devices. I am transcribing these quoted from my audiobook, so they may be inexact, but the meaning is
the same.

1. **Be transparent**. Vendors should clearly state how their security works, which threads they secure against and which they don't. [...]
2. **Make the software patchable**. [...] vendors also need to patch quickly, once vulnerabilities are discovered. [...]
3. **Test preproduction**. All software should be tested for security before it is released.
4. **Enable secure defaults operation**. Devices should be secure out of the box, without requiring users to configure them.
5. **Fail predictively and safely**. If a device loses its Internet connection it should fail gracefully, in a way that it does not cause any harm.
6. **Use standard protocols and implementations**. Standard protocols are generally more secure and better tested, and custom protocols are the opposite. [...]
7. **Avoid known vulnerabilities**. Vendors should not ship products that contain known vulnerabilities.
8. **Preserve offline functionality**. Users should be able to turn off all incoming and outgoing network connections while still being able to use the device. [...]
9. **Encrypt and authenticate data**. Data should be encrypted on the devices and communications to and from them should both encrypted and authenticated.
10. **Support responsible security research**. Vendors should allow research on their products and welcome vulnerability reports, not harass researchers.

I like them all, but if I was pressed to choose one I think I would go with _Enable secure defaults
operation_. For me, this is the principle that would have the biggest impact in my circle making my
loved ones safer.

Do you have a favorite?

I hope to post a list, from the same chapter, for security principles for our data, not our devices.
