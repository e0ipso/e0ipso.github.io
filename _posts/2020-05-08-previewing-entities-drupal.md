I have recorded a video tutorial highlighting some of the features of a module I created for Drupal recently. This is
the [Entity Reference Preview Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_reference_preview).

<!-- more -->

When you preview the latest version of an entity (ex: a node) you only preview that entity. That means that referenced entities in that page are rendered with the published version, not the latest. This module addresses that.

When prompted, many people ask: _Wait! that is not the default behavior already?_

Have you ever wanted to preview a listing from a view (or a block, or a layout builder page, ...) with the latest version of the embedded entities? This module allows you to do that.
