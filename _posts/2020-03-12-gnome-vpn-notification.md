I [use a setup that ensures that I am connected to a VPN](https://mateuaguilo.com/privacy/2019/12/27/network-editor/)
when I join certain Wi-Fi networks. However, sometimes I connect to other networks and I forget to check for the key
icon that reminds me I am not connected to my VPN.

I would like to have a GNOME extension that pops a notification whenever I am not connected to a VPN. Then it would be
very hard to ignore, since I use [Notifications Alert](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/258/notifications-alert-on-user-menu).
