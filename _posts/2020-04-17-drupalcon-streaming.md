If the Drupal Association decides to go virtual for DrupalCon, I really hope Software [ethics](/web-development/drupal/2020/03/06/google-slides-no-longer-mandatory/)
is one important feature when deciding how to do it.

We have the chance to double down on our commitment towards freedom instead of spending kindly donated money and
volunteer time in commercial, proprietary, and potentially unethical software. The Free Software Foundation celebrated
their annual conference [LibrePlanet](https://libreplanet.org/2020/) virtually, and they are sharing how they did it.

  - [How to livestream a conference in just under a week](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/how-to-livestream-a-conference-in-just-under-a-week)
  - [LibrePlanet day 1: Can free software carry an entire online conference? Yes, it can!](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/libreplanet-day-1-can-free-software-carry-an-entire-online-conference-yes-it-can)
  - [Everything you need to know about LibrePlanet 2020, now fully online!](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/everything-you-need-to-know-about-libreplanet-2020-now-fully-online)

Let's reach out to them, let's build bridges with other Free Software organizations, let's collaborate.

EDIT: The Drupal Association just posted that [DrupalCon Global 2020](https://events.drupal.org/global2020) will be an entirely on-line event. I will be happy to assist the DA in figuring out the ethical solution for this conference, should the DA need it.
