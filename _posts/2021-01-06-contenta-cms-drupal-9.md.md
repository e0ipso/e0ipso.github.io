You may know [Contenta CMS](https://www.contentacms.org). It is a decoupled Drupal starter kit.
It is aimed to teach developers, and site builders, about the tools available in the decoupled
landscape. It also serves as an example for both Drupal and client side best practices.

It took a while, but [the distribution](https://github.com/contentacms/contenta_jsonapi) and all
the associated projects are now running on Drupal 9.
